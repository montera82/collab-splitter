# Collab splitter

Collaboration Splitter allows to create a cheap contract in charge of
receiving and splitting Ethereum and ERC20 payments. It can be used to
split earnings from artworks sales if multiple artists were involved or as
the recipient of royalties compatible with the new [EIP-2981: NFT Royalty Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981)

The project has several components:

- **Smartcontracts** ([`contracts/`](contracts/) folder)
- **SDK** ([`sdk/`](sdk/) folder)
- **Website** ([`website/`](website/) folder) available at [https://purple-disk-1468.on.fleek.co/](https://purple-disk-1468.on.fleek.co/)
